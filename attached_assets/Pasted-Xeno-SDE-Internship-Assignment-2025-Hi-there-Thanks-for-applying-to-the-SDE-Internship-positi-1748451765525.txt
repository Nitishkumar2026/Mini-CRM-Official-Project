Xeno SDE Internship Assignment – 2025
Hi there! 👋

Thanks for applying to the SDE Internship position at Xeno. We’re excited to get to know you
through this hands-on assignment that reflects the kind of real-world challenges we solve every
day.
🚀 Assignment Goal:
Build a Mini CRM Platform that enables customer segmentation, personalized campaign
delivery, and intelligent insights using modern tools and approaches.

📌 Scope of Work
✅ 1. Data Ingestion APIs
● Create secure, well-documented REST APIs to ingest customers and orders data.
● Use Postman or Swagger UI to demonstrate API usage.
● ✅ Brownie Points: Implement a pub-sub architecture using a message broker (Kafka,
RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, etc.) where:
○ API layer handles only validation
○ Actual data persistence happens asynchronously via a consumer service

✅ 2. Campaign Creation UI
Build a simple web application that lets a user:
● Define audience segments using flexible rule logic (e.g., spend > INR 10,000 AND
visits < 3 OR inactive for 90 days)
● Combine conditions using AND/OR with a dynamic rule builder

● Preview audience size before saving the segment
● After saving, redirect to a campaign history page showing:
○ List of past campaigns
○ Delivery stats (sent, failed, audience size)
○ Most recent campaign at the top

✅ Bonus: Implement a clean, intuitive UX (drag-and-drop, visual rule blocks, or other creative
approaches)

✅ 3. Campaign Delivery & Logging
● On saving a segment, initiate a new campaign:
○ Store campaign details in a communication_log table
○ Send a personalized message to each customer via a dummy vendor API
■ Example message: "Hi Mohit, here’s 10% off on your next order!"
○ The Vendor API should simulate real-world delivery success/failure (~90% SENT,
~10% FAILED)
○ Vendor API must hit a Delivery Receipt API on your backend
● The Delivery Receipt API should:
○ Update the delivery status in the communication log
○ ✅ Brownie Points: Use a consumer-driven process that updates DB in
batches, even if API hits are individual

✅ 4. Authentication

● Implement Google OAuth 2.0-based authentication
● Ensure that only logged-in users can create audiences or view campaigns

✅ 5. AI Integration
Incorporate at least one AI-powered feature into your CRM app. This is an opportunity to
showcase your creativity and practical use of modern tools. Some ideas:
🧠 Suggested AI Use Cases
1. Natural Language to Segment Rules
Allow users to write prompts like "People who haven’t shopped in 6 months and spent
over ₹5K" and convert them into logical rules.
2. AI-Driven Message Suggestions
Given a campaign objective (e.g., "bring back inactive users"), generate 2–3 message
variants to choose from.
✅ Bonus: Recommend relevant product or offer images based on message tone or
audience.
3. Campaign Performance Summarization
Instead of just showing sent/failed stats, generate a human-readable insight summary:

"Your campaign reached 1,284 users. 1,140 messages were delivered. Customers with
> ₹10K spend had a 95% delivery rate."

4. Smart Scheduling Suggestions
Recommend the best time/day to send a campaign based on customer activity patterns
(you can mock or simulate this logic).
5. Audience Lookalike Generator
Suggest additional audiences based on the characteristics of high-performing segments
(e.g., people similar to those who responded last time).
6. Auto-tagging Campaigns
Use AI to label campaigns (e.g., "Win-back", "High Value Customers") based on
audience and message intent.

Use any public AI APIs (OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Replicate, etc.) or local models. Just clearly
document what you used and why.

🛠 Preferred Tech Stack
● Frontend: React.js or Next.js
● Backend: Node.js or Java (Spring Boot)
● Database: MySQL or MongoDB
● Optional: Kafka / RabbitMQ / Redis Streams for pub-sub
● Optional: AI tools, LLM APIs, image APIs for personalization

🧪 Evaluation Criteria
We’ll be assessing:
● Code quality and project structure
● Creative problem solving and clean UX
● Scalability (especially in ingestion & delivery flows)
● AI integration and thoughtful use of tools
● Completeness of your solution (demo, README, hosting)
● Communication skills in your demo video

We’ll go through your project in detail during interviews, so plagiarism is a strict no-go. All
work must be your own, and we’ll ask you questions based on your implementation decisions.

📦 Submission Requirements

● ✅ Public GitHub repo with well-organized code
● ✅ Deployed project (can use Render, Vercel, Railway, etc.)
● ✅ Demo video (max 7 mins) in your own voice explaining:
○ Features
○ How you approached the problem
○ Any trade-offs made
○ AI features added
● ✅ README.md with:
○ Local setup instructions
○ Architecture diagram
○ Summary of AI tools and other tech used
○ Known limitations or assumptions
